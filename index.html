    <b>Children from families with lower incomes score significantly lower on vocabulary, communication skills, and assessments, as well as on their knowledge of numbers and ability to concentrate. Furthermore, their counterparts in higher-income households outperform them in studies, sports, and cooperative play. Students from low-income families are more likely to leave school without graduating.</b>

    <b>Poverty and lack of education is a big challenge being faced by the world, the problem is low-income families don’t put their children in schools. Even if they want to there are no proper schools available. Government schools do not provide quality education and children who attend these schools end up doing menial jobs. Low-income families are less likely to be able to afford proper nutrition and sometimes lack day-to-day necessities at home. With little financial education and low-earnings, these families might have to send their children to school without breakfast or lunch. A study shows that not eating enough reduces the brain's capacity to learn, and students who lack nutrition cannot perform as good as their other classmates.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Students from impoverished family units tend to have lower levels of verbal and thinking aptitude than their friends because their parents are less likely to read to them. With longer working hours, lower levels of education, and fewer literary resources, such parents are unable to give their kids the same level of attention and thus these children have a limited vocabulary. Moreover, children from low-income families are not asked to find solutions to problems or have ever received advice on how to handle difficult situations before entering school.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>There are scholarships and child education allowance for the poor and most of them receive it. But scholarships are not available to everyone. Poverty affects their learning process, and most students born into poverty live in a bad environment. The environment is one of the factors that shape attitude, and a bad attitude would burden the learning process. People born into more fortunate families would have better access to education, they don’t need to worry about expenses, and are able to get more education by hiring tutors or buying books to learn by themselves.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Most parents in slums don’t understand the importance of education and are reluctant to send their children to school. Some parents don’t have sufficient finances to educate their children, even if they do they send their kids to government schools, and the quality of education is not as good, and sometimes they have a single classroom and one teacher for separate standards to teach both of them at the same time.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Poverty in India has increased to such an extent that these children are stuck in a vicious cycle, even if they do finish their primary education, they later drop out of school and start doing menial jobs which again leads to poverty.</b>
